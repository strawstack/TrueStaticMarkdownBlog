# TrueStaticMarkdownBlog

A minimalist static markdown blog framework.

# How to Use

The `post` function is a tagged template literal function that converts a markdown string to html and appends the html to the document body. One could make an index.html homepage for their blog, and several `post.html` files. Navigating to a `post file` would cause that blog article to render from markdown to html. Note, if one is using VS Code, it's possible to write a Syntax Highlighting Language Extension to highlight markdown syntax present inside tagged template literal strings inside html files.
